        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom">Our initial goal was some sort of design solution that would help tackle the issue of accessibility. Through research and interviews, we found that existing platforms for accessibility ratings are outdated, poorly designed, and obsolete. We asked ourselves: How can we promote awareness of and improve accessibility to Deaf-friendly environments?

        <h1 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom">DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          We began the project under the broad topic of general "accessibility." To help us begin narrowing down our scope, we all created our own moodboards to demonstrate to the group what came to our minds when we each thought of accessibility. From there onwards, we discussed which aspect of accessibility that was shared sounded the most interesting and compelling to address. With that, we narrowed down to focus solely on accessibility for the Deaf community.
        </h2>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          Going forward, we each conducted multiple interviews with representatives from the Deaf community to better immerse ourselves in the unique aspects of Deaf culture. From these interviews, we gleaned a lot of useful insight and developed several "How Can We..." statements to drive our focus into a specific area.
        </h2>
        <img class="vert-img" src="../Media/woh/hcw.jpg" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom" />
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">
          Once we had figured out what we specifically wanted to target after narrowing down our choice of How Can We statements, we decided to pursue a technological approach due to what we had learned from our interviews- that Deaf people are highly tech-savvy. We researched existing platforms for Deaf people to gain information about Deaf-friendly spaces, and we realized that they were largely outdated and user-unfriendly. For an idea like this to be streamlined, we realized that it had to be incorporated somehow into existing, popular apps. That's how we decided to mockup an add-on mobile application.

          With our simple prototypes completed, we each took the time to prototype a design of 3 or so screens in Sketch, and presented them to the group so we could decide on a design scheme. Then, we took the time to collectively mock up the most important screens that would be able to get across the crux of our idea when we presented to the rest of the teams.

However, given more time and resources, we planned next to create an interactive prototype of our application and conduct extensive user testing on members of the Deaf community who we had been in contact with. We would use feedback gained from testing sessions to continue to iterate our design, smoothing out usability errors and breakdowns to the best of our abilities.
